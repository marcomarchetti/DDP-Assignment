About this project
==================

-   This Project shows 2015 estimates on international migrations and it
    is based on two data sets from **United Nations** and from
    **UNICEF**.  
-   United Nation data set contains a migrants origin-destination matrix
    and UNICEF data set contains information about childs, refugees,
    asylum seekers and internally displaced persons.  
-   Both data set refers to the same basic data from United Nations so
    the data are consistents and can be merged.

The project is an assignment of Coursera Developing Data Products Course
(John Hopkins University).

maps.  
- **Immigration Map**: shows the migrants destination country in red and
the migrants origin countries in blue gradations.  
- **Emigration Map**: shows the migrants origin country in red and the
migrants destination countries in blue gradations.

The maps are zoomables using plotly bar commands or the mouse scroll
