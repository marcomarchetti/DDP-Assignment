International Migrations
========================================================

autosize: true

The project is an assignment of Coursera Developing Data Products Course (John Hopkins University).

Overview
========================================================
- This Project shows 2015 estimates on international migrations and it is based on two data sets from **United Nations** and from **UNICEF**.   
- United Nation data set contains a migrants origin-destination matrix and UNICEF data set contains  information about childs, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons.  
- Both data set refers to the same basic data from United Nations so the data are consistents and can be merged. 
- The Application was developed using **R**, **Plotly** and **Shiny** and shows migration data by Country:
 - Immigration Origin-Destination map  
 - Emigration Origin-Destination map  
 - Num. of Emigrants and Immigrants (Total and Childs)
 - Num. of Refugee (Total and Childs)
 - Num. of Asylum Seekers
 - The Internal Displacement

 



Data sets
========================================================
## United Nations data set:
The [International migrant stock 2015](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml)  presents estimates of international migrant by age, sex and origin. Estimates are presented for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 and are available for all countries and areas of the world. The estimates are based on official statistics on the foreign-born or the foreign population.

## UNICEF data set:
The [UNICEF dataset](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-migration-and-displacement/migration/) shows 2015 data of Child migrants and refugees (international migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons.)

App: Server
========================================================
class: small-code
The Server Side App gets, clean and merge data from the two data sets, calculates percentage of Childs and finally creates plots. As an example we show a little part of the server side code.
- The first part of this code gets unicef data.  
- The second part of this code print the Total number of immigrants to Italy in 2015 and the number of Under 18. On the project, the server creates two maps (immigration and emigration) using **renderPlotly** function.  
- The shiny UI uses **plotlyOutput** to plot the maps.

# Geting UNICEF data (Shiny Server code)

# Read Unicef Data

colnames(CMR2015) <- c("ISOCode","Countries",
                       "MgrDestTot","MgrDestPerc","MgrDestPercU18", "MgrOrigTot","MgrOrigPerc",

                       "AsylDestTot","AsylOrigTot","IntDisplTot","RatifNum")

# Print Total Immigrants and Childs (this is an example code, the shiny server creates maps) 
MgrDestTot <- CMR2015[CMR2015$Countries == "Italy","MgrDestTot"]*1000
MgrDestU18 <- MgrDestTot * as.numeric(CMR2015[CMR2015$Countries == "Italy","MgrDestPercU18"])/100
MgrDestTot <- formatC(as.numeric(MgrDestTot), decimal.mark=",", big.mark=".", digits = 0, format = "f")
MgrDestU18  <- formatC(as.numeric(MgrDestU18) , decimal.mark=",", big.mark=".", digits = 0, format = "f")
paste('(2015) Immigrants in', CMR2015[CMR2015$Countries == "Italy","Countries"], " - Totals:", MgrDestTot, "- Under 18:", MgrDestU18)

```
App: User Interface
========================================================
The UI allows the user to select a "Country Name" and shows migration data on the sidebar panel and 2 choropleth maps on separates tabs. The maps shows Migration Origin-Destination matrices and the selected Country is Red.
